                    <p>For my Data structures class I made this project. The goal of this project was to 
                    create an application that would compress information in this case books. Information may takes much space espcially for 
                    certain types of information. Using unordered maps by taking common used phrases in books the application was able to 
                    take phrases into keys which was able to compress the books</p>

                    <p> I wanted to design an app that would allow city folk to find accesible recommendations for dinner and lunch. 
                    I conducted research on the problem, if it was a popular solution worth investing time in and what kinds of solutions were viable.
                    Using the information collected from the survey I designed an app that would function as a social media app that allow freinds to create 
                    recommendation lists that they can share with other friends.</p>

                    I wanted to see how influential youtbe still is. By using the api I took the largest fifteen gaming youtbers and assessed how they have been performing in the last 5 years 
                    I collected the data using the youtube api, using python I was able to clean and interpret the data. I used Jupyter Notebook to document the data and

                    a gaming store using the RAWG Api we were able to make a store that would allow users to make an account and then create a cart and then "buy" and 
                    also "sell" games. This website was made as a model second hand game store. We colloborated together and used github to finish and AWS to 
                    host the website.
